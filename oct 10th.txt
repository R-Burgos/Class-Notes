Git Intro Notes:

Git is a Distributed Version Control System. DVCS
Means no central server is required, work can be done offline. Colaboration is easy with this.
Allows to keep track of all versions of software and changes made.
Git works on any platform.
Git tracks changes to files.

Version Control is a means for managing your source code.
Allows access to previous versions of your code, history of changes.
Have multiple working copies of code
Makes backing up code trivial
Easy to share you work with others.

Git is not the same as GitHub
Git is a tool to manage your source code history.
GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories.

My PC is a local repository.  GitHub is a remote repository, in the cloud.

Commits means saving in Git.

git commit commmand captures a snapshot of the projects current staged changes.

git clone:
puts a copy of the remote repository on your machine

git push:
move changes from local repo to remote repo

git pull:
pulls latest version from remote repo to local repo

GIT WORKFLOW
git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.

git add <filename> add a specific file to staging area

git add . (aka git add all)
. stands for all.  Easy way to add all chnages to staging area

git commit -m "a descriptive message"

git push -u origin main # only for first push
git push #you can just git push after you setup the -u(upsteram flag) on whater branch you specified(main).
