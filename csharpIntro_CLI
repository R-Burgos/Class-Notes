CLI: command-line interface

Solution file (.sln) 
A solution is a container used by Visual Studio to organize one or more related projects.
When you open a solution in VS, it automatically loads all the projects the solution contains.
Think of the solution as the application that contains all the other files that make it work.

Project file (.csproj)
Contains all the source code that is compiled. It contains compiler settings and other configuration files.
Think of this as the first main folder within the application.  This folder holds all your code.

Source code (.cs) <- cs for C#
This is the code that you write.

Solution files contain project files which contain source code.
