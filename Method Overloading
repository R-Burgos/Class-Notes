Method Overloading
Methods cannot have the same name but they can have a similar signature.
A signature is methods having the same method name, return type, and same parameters.
Allows methods to be used for lots of different situations.

Method overloading is when multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.
When the method is called the arguments are the data you pass into the methods parameters.
Essentially copy the method and change the return type and input type.  Keep the same name, the parameters change.
